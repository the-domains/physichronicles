What are the must-have skills for 21st-century? 

One could say you things like "analytical thinking", "critical thinking", "EQ", etc. But here I'm referring to a more concrete, tangible skills. And I think there are 2 of them, at least:

Communication. By "communication", I'm referring to the ability to present oneself well to potential employer and/or investor (i.e. presentation skill), to colleagues (i.e. management and organisational skill, or what I would refer to as "office politics" skill), to employee (i.e. leadership skill), and to the mass (i.e. public communication skill). 

Coding. I always think of  "coding" as a form of communication as well. However, instead of communicating with fellow human, "coding" is communicating with machines. I think it is a totally different skill altogether from "communication" for, in machine world, there is no politics, no feeling, no impression whatsoever. You need not be tactful when dealing with machine. On the contrary, you need be direct and precise in telling machine what to do. 

The ability to communicate and command machine (and that machine could be anything ranging from an automatic coffee maker to a supercomputer) is becoming imperative due to a simple fact that nowadays our lives are deeply entangled with them, and it is going to be even more so in future.
